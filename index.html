        My name is Fabulous or should I say that is what people call me on campus. I got admitted to study Medicine and Surgery in 2021. The journey through 100L as a premed student hasn't been an easy one but I sailed through with the grace of God.

    <h1 class="three">My First Day In LASU</h1>
    <p class="six">
        I met Maleek online few days after we got admitted. We vibed and became good friends real quick. He's the first person I met in PPL. I helped him with some of his baggage and luggage when he was packing in.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next day I rushed to school after hearing a class was ongoing at the <abbr title="Masters of Business Administration">MBA</abbr> hall. I rushed to school even when I had no idea where the hall was located. I got to school and called Blessing. Blessing or Doc Tray as Eichrost would call her picked up the call and was directing me to the MBA hall. Blessing is a long time online friend of mine from JTSF tutorials on whatsapp. We've been friends since UTME days and we'll be meeting for the first time on campus. She saw me posted few of my pictures online and she recognized me at first glance despite me using face mask. We exchanged pleasantries and we were both delighted to meet each other.
    </p>
    <p>
        Two days later after I met Blessing on campus, the boss himself in person of Eichrost arrived on campus. I've been friends with Eichrost too for a little while. I also met a few course mates and friends like Atom, Dara, Aminat, Wunmi, Semi, Shade, Ola, Scalpel, Shalom and a lot more.

    <h2 class="four">Our Brainstorming Group.</h2>
    <p>
        With the idea coming from Eichrost, Blessing and myself we decided to open a small brainstorm group of 10-12 members few weeks to our First Semester Exams. At the start of second semester, we decided to make the group a little more elaborate by adding some coursemates and some physical science students like Intimidation, Logic, Shemex, VectorInGod, Mystigan e.t.c. We ignited the group with our constant brainstorm activities as we helped each other academically in one way or the other.
    </p>

    <h3 class="five">How I Prepared For My First Semester Exams.</h3>
    <p>
        For first semester, I offered nine courses. The nine courses are listed below:
    </p>

        <ol>
            <li>BIO101</li>
            <li>BIO103</li>
            <li>BOT101</li>
            <li>CHM101</li>
            <li>CHM103</li>
            <li>GNS101</li>
            <li>PHY101</li>
            <li>PHY105</li>
            <li>ZOO101</li>
        </ol>

    <p class="seven">For BIO101, I read the lecture slide. Some topics may seem bulky or hard to understand so I use Prof. Dave explains and Khan academy channel on youtube for those topics for better understanding. As for online mcqs, there are thousands of site on the internet but I prefer using Study adda, Toppr, and Byjus because I find those sites explicit and some of my exam questions were directly from those sites.
    </p>

    <p class="eight">
        For BIO103, this is practical. It involves less reading but more research. We also didn't write exams for any practical courses.
    </p>

    <p class="nine">
        For BOT101, I read the lecturer's slide as well and as for online mcqs I used only study adda for BOT because I feel that site is enough and a lot of my questions were from that site. You may decide to use more sites if you feel like.
    </p>

    <p class="ten">
        For CHM101, this is the number one course I would advice you not to read out of slide on because CHM lecturers will <strong>NEVER</strong> set exam questions out of their lecture notes. Attend every classes and write down the notes as the lecturer is dictating. Do not wait for your friend to snap you written notes as your friend might have missed out on some vital points in class. Instead, be in the class and write your note yourself. In first semester, you may do a little calculations in chm. I would recommend using Organic Chemistry Tutor videos on YouTube. You can also use it for the theory aspects the lecturer explained in class but you don't seem to grab in class.
    </p>

    <p class="eleven">
        For CHM103, this is practical as well and you don't need to stress yourself much.
    </p>

    <p class="twelve">
        For GNS101, just read the textbook very well and brainstorm on it. Also, tutorials like Mastermind, Aqeel, Spencer, Excel e.t.c will drop some pdfs few days to exam on GNS101. Do well to read those pdfs. Lecturers may decide to set all of their questions on one of those pdfs. Don't put any fear in your mind if you're not in any tutorial. Everyone will eventually get those pdfs via whatsapp groups.
    </p>

    <p class="thirteen">
        For PHY101, I read out of slide a lot but it was not really useful in the end. The most important thing is to take lecturer's materials seriously and to solve as many as posible online mcqs. I would recommend Toppr because I used it and it was effective. You can use other sites too. I also used Organic Chemistry Tutor on YouTube. I watched a lot of his videos on mechanics, SHM, Hydrodynamics and a lot more. He is the best tutor I had during my 100L days. I would have watched them a week or two before the lecturer teaches for better understanding of what the lecturer is going to teach. As for maths students, I would recommend this site for you guys too. The tutor is very explanatory and explicit in his videos.</p>

    <p class="fourteen">
        For PHY105, it is just like other practicals. No need to stress yourself very much.
    </p>

    <p class="fifteen">For ZOO101, Hmmm you see this course, it is very complex but with consistent reading and revision you'll realize it's not very hard. After reading it you can explore sites like Byjus, Toppr and study adda for mcqs.</p>

    <h3>Top Mcqs Sites I Used</h3>
    <div style="overflow-x: auto;">
    <table id="lobe">
        <tr>
            <th>Course</th>
            <th>Site</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>BIO101</td>
            <td>Study adda, Byjus, Toppr</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>BO101</td>
            <td>Study adda</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>CHM101</td>
            <td>Toppr</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>PHY101</td>
            <td>Toppr</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>ZOO101</td>
            <td>Toppr, Byjus, study adda</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    </div>

    <p class="linkk">Are you wondering how to access those sites above? It's not hard. Let's say you're done reading your lecturer's slide on Protozoa in ZOO101 and you need Toppr mcqs on it; just go to google and search in this format <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=protozoa+mcqs+toppr&oq=protozoa+mcqs+toppr&aqs=chrome..69i57j33i160.18356j1j15&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">Protozoa mcqs toppr</a>. It will take you to the page and I hope you know how to find your way from there.</p>

    <p class="advice">
        I should have shared some tips about second semester too but I believe by the end of first semester, you would have known what works best for you and how to conquer this semester.I would advice that you partake in brainstorm activities because it helps a lot. Don't hide PDFs from your coursemates because you wanna transit. Help each other. Help others transit too. I pray you all transit with great results. Looking forward to seeing you in Lasucom, Ikeja.
